# Word-Guess-Game

This is essentially a hangman game created from scratch with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

To play, press any letter on the keyboard.
* Each key pressed will be registered as a guess and stored in the bottom left corner.
* For each incorrect guess, the number of guesses remaining will decrement.
* For correct guesses, the number of guesses remaining will not decrement.
* The game will automatically reset for each win/loss.
